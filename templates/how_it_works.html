    <h1>How It Works</h1>
    <p>Four steps. No account. No JavaScript. No tracking.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Step 1 -->
  <div class="step-card">
    <div class="step-card__number">1</div>
    <h2 class="step-card__title">Choose Your Currencies</h2>
    <p class="step-card__desc">Pick what you want to send and what you want to receive. We support hundreds of tokens across major blockchains — all sourced from the NEAR Intents network. No account or wallet connection needed.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="step-connector">|</div>

  <!-- Step 2 -->
  <div class="step-card">
    <div class="step-card__number">2</div>
    <h2 class="step-card__title">Get a Quote</h2>
    <p class="step-card__desc">Enter your amount and destination address. We request a real-time quote from NEAR Intents and show you exactly what you'll receive, the exchange rate, and a full fee breakdown. The quote is passed through at cost — zero markup.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="step-connector">|</div>

  <!-- Step 3 -->
  <div class="step-card">
    <div class="step-card__number">3</div>
    <h2 class="step-card__title">Send Your Deposit</h2>
    <p class="step-card__desc">Confirm the swap and you'll get a one-time deposit address with a QR code. Send the exact amount from any wallet. The address is generated by NEAR Intents — your funds never touch our server.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="step-connector">|</div>

  <!-- Step 4 -->
  <div class="step-card">
    <div class="step-card__number">4</div>
    <h2 class="step-card__title">Receive Your Tokens</h2>
    <p class="step-card__desc">NEAR Intents detects your deposit, executes the swap through decentralized market makers, and sends the output tokens directly to your recipient address. The page auto-refreshes to show live status.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Why Zero Fees? -->
  <div class="info-card">
    <h3 class="info-card__title">Why Zero Fees?</h3>
    <div class="info-card__text">
      <p>NEAR Intents charges zero protocol fees for swaps. Most "free" swap services are resellers who silently add 1-5% markup to the rate you see. uSwap Zero passes the NEAR Intents rate through with exactly zero markup, zero commission, zero hidden fees.</p>
      <p>The only cost is the market maker's spread — the difference between the spot price and the rate they offer. This spread exists on every exchange and DEX. We just don't add anything on top of it.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Why No JavaScript? -->
  <div class="info-card">
    <h3 class="info-card__title">Why No JavaScript?</h3>
    <div class="info-card__text">
      <p>JavaScript enables tracking, fingerprinting, and data exfiltration. By serving pure HTML and CSS, we make it verifiable that this site cannot track you. There are no analytics scripts, no session cookies, no local storage writes.</p>
      <p>The only JavaScript on this site is an optional 8-line clipboard helper for the "Copy Address" button. It has a noscript fallback. Disable JS entirely and everything still works.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Why Open Source? -->
  <div class="info-card">
    <h3 class="info-card__title">Why Open Source?</h3>
    <div class="info-card__text">
      <p>The entire application is a single Go binary with zero external dependencies. The source code, CI pipeline, and deployment history are all public. You can clone the repo, read every line, build it yourself, and verify the deployed binary matches.</p>
      <p>Visit the <a href="/verify" class="text-accent">Verify page</a> for deployment metadata, or <a href="/source" class="text-accent">view the source</a> on GitHub.</p>
